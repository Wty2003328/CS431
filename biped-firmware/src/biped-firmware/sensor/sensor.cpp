     *  relies on timely and accurate information to maintain the unstable equilibrium.

     *  On the contrary, slow domain tasks are more suited to a lower execution frequency,

     *  the calculation of X velocity, which is determined by the number of encoder
     *  steps over time, illustrates this point well. A shorter measurement period results

     *  of non-essential sensors such as the time-of-flight sensors. Operating these tasks
     *  in the slow domain is more efficient and performance-friendly, balancing accuracy
